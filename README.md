# BnT-Discord-bot
BnT bot was made for the BooksAndTea discord server. If you like books you are most welcome to join (google us!)<br/>
If you just like the functionality, feel free to host a copy of the bot on your own. Although the code is a bit messy right now, so be warned :p

## How to Use
the bot is based on SinisterRectus' Discordia API: https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia
Follow the install instructions there (although I'm pretty sure only installing luvit is enough), then clone this repo.
You can run it with: ``luvit bot.lua [keyfile]``
where [keyfile] is a file containing your bots client-secret.
Make sure it's all on 1 line and you end the file with an extra newline
